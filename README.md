# 🌍 AI for Sustainable Development – SDG 3: Health

## 📌 Project Title: Disease Outbreak Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies supervised learning to predict disease outbreaks using real-world health data, supporting Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health & Well-being).

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Disease outbreaks (e.g. malaria, flu, COVID-19) overwhelm health systems. Predicting them early could save lives and help allocate medical resources efficiently.

---

## 🧠 ML Approach

- Supervised learning using Random Forest / Logistic Regression.
- Dataset features include temperature, humidity, population density, previous cases, etc.
- Model classifies whether an outbreak will occur in a given region and time.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Results

- Model Accuracy: 87%
- Precision: 0.85 | Recall: 0.89
- Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve included in visuals.

---

## 🤖 Files Included

- `notebooks/disease_outbreak_prediction.ipynb` – ML workflow & analysis.
- `src/model.py` – Clean Python script version.
- `visuals/charts.png` – Evaluation graphs.
- `requirements.txt` – All libraries used.

---

## ✍️ Ethical Reflection

We acknowledge potential bias in historical disease data (underreporting, region bias) and strive for fairness. Model decisions are interpretable and aim to enhance—not replace—human decisions.
